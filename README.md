🏦 Loan Approval Prediction
This project is a machine learning solution that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on applicant data such as income, credit history, education, and more.

📊 Key Features:
Data preprocessing: missing values handling, encoding categorical features, and feature selection.

Trained multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.).

Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Handled imbalanced data using SMOTE to improve minority class prediction.

🚀 Bonus:
Applied SMOTE to synthetically generate data for underrepresented classes.

Compared model performance before and after class balancing.

📁 Dataset:
Kaggle Loan Approval Prediction Dataset

614 samples, 12 features
